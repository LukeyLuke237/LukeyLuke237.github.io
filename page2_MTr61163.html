                    making the bay one of the best places to visit in Vietnam. A community of around 1,600 people live on Ha Long Bay in four fishing villages: Cua Van, Ba Hang, Cong Tau and Vong Vieng in Hung Thang ward, Ha Long city. They live on floating houses and are sustained through fishing and marine aquaculture.

                <img src="images/hue-4912504_960_720.jpg" alt="Imperial_City">
                <p>
                    The Imperial Citadel is a walled enclosure within the citadel of the city of Hue, the former imperial capital of Vietnam during the Nguyen dynasty. It contains the palaces that housed the imperial family, as well as shrines, gardens, and villas for mandarins.
                    Constructed in 1803 under Emperor Gia Long as a new capital, it mostly served a ceremonial function during the French colonial period. After the end of the monarchy in 1945, it suffered heavy damage and neglect during the Indochina Wars through the 1980s. The Imperial City was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1993 and is undergoing restoration.

                    When visiting Hue, apart from the Imperial Citadel, the Perfume River flowing right beside it is another marvellous site tourists cannot miss.
                    There is a delightful waterfront promenade along the banks of the river and this makes a great place to come for a scenic walk in the evenings. 
                    Hue is often said to have some of the best food in Vietnam and with that in mind you need to make sure that you sample all the delights on a trip here. As Hue was once one of the most important royal cities in Vietnam, it was also one of the premium producers of famed Imperial Banquets. And if you are looking for a sweet treat in the city then make sure to check out the local candy which is made of sesame seeds.
